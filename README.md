## Currency Converter Project
The Currency Converter Project is designed to be a practical application leveraging the Python programming language to create a tool that allows users to convert amounts between different currencies. This project utilizes the ExchangeRate-API for fetching real-time exchange rate data and provides an interface for users to specify the amount in one currency and get the equivalent amount in another currency. Additionally, the project features a user-friendly UI using Streamlit, making it accessible for non-technical users to perform currency conversions with ease.
